Spend evenings outside flipping burgers on the deck or inside snuggled around the fireplace. The interior is reminiscent of a cabin in the mountains and offers a warm, inviting space, complete with the main living area on the upper floor.\n",

Use the deck's gas barbecue to make a filling dinner.\n\n",

Luckily, you'll have your own private spot to do so, though you could also simply sip cocoa, curl up under an afghan, or sit out on the deck's Adirondack chairs with the telescope. Use the deck's gas barbecue to make a filling dinner.\n\n",

For prime skiing visit Northstar, about 12 miles away, or Squaw Valley which is 10 miles away.\n\nAll that skiing may make you want to go back to your cabin to soak in hot tub! Luckily, you'll have your own private spot to do so, though you could also simply sip cocoa, curl up under an afghan, or sit out on the deck's Adirondack chairs with the telescope. Use the deck's gas barbecue to make a filling dinner.\n\n",

When you stay here, you will enjoy amenities like a large outdoor deck surrounded by trees, a cozy gas fireplace inside, a full kitchen, and entertainment amenities like WiFi, cable TV, a VCR, and a DVD player.\n\nDuring your stay, spend a sunny day at the 10-acre West End Beach State Park for paddle-boarding, swimming, tennis, volleyball, or even a picnic by the lake (for access to this state beach, please be aware that there is a nominal, daily fee). On the Fourth of July, this is the best spot in Truckee to catch the fireworks! But like all of Lake Tahoe, Donner Lake is not just a summer destination - during the winter months, you'll be within 15 minutes of Northstar, Sugar Bowl, and Boreal Mountain ski resorts.\n\nWhen you're not out swimming or skiing, this Donner Lake House offers a comfortable, laid-back setting for family vacations, reunions, or getaways with friends. Spend evenings outside flipping burgers on the deck or inside snuggled around the fireplace. The interior is reminiscent of a cabin in the mountains and offers a warm, inviting space, complete with the main living area on the upper floor.\n",
