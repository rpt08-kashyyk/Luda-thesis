On the Fourth of July, this is the best spot in Truckee to catch the fireworks! But like all of Lake Tahoe, Donner Lake is not just a summer destination - during the winter months, you'll be within 15 minutes of Northstar, Sugar Bowl, and Boreal Mountain ski resorts.\n\nWhen you're not out swimming or skiing, this Donner Lake House offers a comfortable, laid-back setting for family vacations, reunions, or getaways with friends. Spend evenings outside flipping burgers on the deck or inside snuggled around the fireplace. The interior is reminiscent of a cabin in the mountains and offers a warm, inviting space, complete with the main living area on the upper floor.\n",
